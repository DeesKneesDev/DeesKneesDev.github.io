        <p><em>Shift Lead | 2020-Currently</em></p>
        <p>I was promoted from <em>Barista</em> to <em>Shift Lead</em> after
           three months of employment with the company for my outstanding
           merchandising and marketing knowledge. I helped the cafe find and solve
           problems such as their waste loss being over <em>$300</em> over their
           limit <em><strong>EVERY. SINGLE. MONTH.</strong></em> for about a year.
           I also help with any in-store adverts and campaigns. (even drawing promotional
           signs when needed!)</p>

        <p><em>Manager | 2012-2020</em></p>
        <p>This was my <em>first</em> place of employment, through which I
           graduated both high school <em>and</em> college while completing full
           time hours. I was promoted from <em>Barista</em> to <em>Manager</em>
           within my first year with the company for my <em><strong>excellent</strong></em>
           service to both the customers <em>and</em> to my fellow employees. I was
           tasked with things such as cross-training employees from other stores for
           successful employment.</p>
